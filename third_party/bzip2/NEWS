Changes in version 1.0.7
========================

* The new maintainer of bzip2 is Federico Mena Quintero
  <federico@gnome.org>.

* Bzip2 is now maintained under version control at
  https://gitlab.com/federicomenaquintero/bzip2

The following are changes that have accumulated in various
distributions since bzip2-1.0.6:

* Fix bashisms in bzgrep (Led).

* Fix unsafe strcpy in bzip2recover (Ivana Varekova).
  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=226979

* Fix bzgrep so it doesn't always return a 0 exit code (Kristýna Streitová)

* CVE-2016-3189 - Fix use-after-free in bzip2recover (Jakub Martisko)
  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1319648

* Use O_CLOEXEC for bzopen()

* Fix mingw compilation (Marty E. Plummer, Dylan Baker)

* Fix Visual Studio compilation (Phil Ross)

* Fix #10: bunzip2 -qt returns 0 for corrupt archives (Wenzong Fan)

* Fix undefined behavior in macros with the shift-left operator
  (Paul Kehrer)

* Fix a 'not a normal file' error when compressing large files on
  Windows (Phil Ross)

* Don't let bzip2recover overwrite existing output files by default
  (Colin Phipps)

This is a new bugfix:

* CVE-2019-12900 - Detect out-of-range nSelectors in corrupted files
  (Albert Astals Cid).  Found through fuzzing karchive.

Build system changes:

* Instead of the historical Makefile, bzip2 now comes with two
  supported build systems (Meson and CMake), and an unsupported one
  (makefile.msc).  Either of the supported ones should build a shared
  library as per modern practices.  Please see the file COMPILING.md for
  details.

Special thanks:

* Julian Seward for ceding maintainership and providing lots of advice
  and interesting anecdotes.

* Mark Wielaard for constructing a repository based on tarballs from
  the original releases.  For a different construction by Evan Nemerson, see
  https://gitlab.com/federicomenaquintero/bzip2/issues/7

* Erich Córdoba and Jordan Petridis for the Continuous Integration
  infrastructure.

* Phil Ross for the Windows build fixes.
  
* Dylan Baker for the Meson infrastructure.

* Micah Snyder for the CMake infrastructure.

* Stanislav Brabec for an Autotools infrastructure, which
  became the basis for the Meson/CMake ones.

* Jens Korte for fixing up the README.

* All the people who submitted distribution-specific patches.
