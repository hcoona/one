These are the patches from openSUSE that are not included in this Git
repository:

* bzip2-point-to-doc-pkg.patch - modifies the README file to mention a
  bzip2-doc package instead of the bzip2.txt file from the source
  distribution.  This is suitable for distributions which repackage
  the original files into different packages.
