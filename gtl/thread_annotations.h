// This header file contains macro definitions for thread safety annotations
// that allow developers to document the locking policies of multi-threaded
// code. The annotations can also help program analysis tools to identify
// potential thread safety issues.
//
// Note that the annotations we use are described as deprecated in the Clang
// documentation, linked below. E.g. we use ABSL_EXCLUSIVE_LOCKS_REQUIRED where the
// Clang docs use REQUIRES.
//
// http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThreadSafetyAnalysis.html
//
// We use the deprecated Clang annotations to match Abseil (relevant header
// linked below) and its ecosystem of libraries. We will follow Abseil with
// respect to upgrading to more modern annotations.
//
// https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/blob/master/absl/base/thread_annotations.h
//
// These annotations are implemented using compiler attributes. Using the macros
// defined here instead of raw attributes allow for portability and future
// compatibility.
//
// When referring to mutexes in the arguments of the attributes, you should
// use variable names or more complex expressions (e.g. my_object->mutex_)
// that evaluate to a concrete mutex object whenever possible. If the mutex
// you want to refer to is not in scope, you may use a member pointer
// (e.g. &MyClass::mutex_) to refer to a mutex in some (unknown) object.
